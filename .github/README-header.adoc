This is a git clone of Daniel Pfeiffer's excellent `makepp` program (a _"Compatible but improved replacement for make"_).

The original project appears to be hosted only on a sourceforge CVS repository.

This git repo and accompanying pseudo releases/tags are only here to make life easier for eventually contributing to `makepp` in a git/github friendly manner.
That would best be done thru a fork, which must happen elsewhere.

Please do NOT send any changes or pull requests here. No source changes are going to be posted in this particular repository.
All changes and contributions should be submitted to the original author thru the project's customary channels (links below).
