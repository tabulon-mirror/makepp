This is a git clone of Daniel Pfeiffer's excellent `makepp` program (i.e. a _"Compatible but improved replacement for make"_).

The original project appears to be  hosted on a sourceforge CVS repository.

This git repo and accompanying pseudo releases/tags are only here to make life easier for eventually contributing to `makepp` in a git/github friendly manner (i.e. thru a fork, which must happen elsewhere). 

IN other words, no source changes are going to be posted in this particular repository.  

Therefore, please do send any changes or pull requests here.  All changes and contributions should be submitted to the original author thru the project's customary channels (links below).
